# Secure CI/CD Pipeline

This repository is created to achieve the following goals:
1. Bootstrap a simple Python Flask application.
2. Setup a basic CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
3. Integrate security scanning tools into the pipeline.
4. Run automated security scans and checks on every push/pull request.

## Bonus
As a bonus, we'll attempt deployment of the flask app using Docker to DockerHub.
